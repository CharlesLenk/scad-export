# SCAD Export

OpenSCAD is a powerful parametric modeling program, but has some limitations. One of these limitations is that exporting models to files in OpenSCAD is a manual process, which makes exporting a large number of models to separate files or folders tedious and slow. This project aims to address that limitation by allowing the model and folder paths to be defined programmatically, and using multithreading to render models in parallel, leading to an overall much faster and automated export for complex projects.

For usage and API documentation see the [SCAD Export Wiki](https://github.com/CharlesLenk/scad-export/wiki).
